# Global CO2 Emissions Dashboard

## Overview
An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing global fossil fuel emissions data from 1750 to 2021. This project provides insights into historical trends, geographical patterns, and the relationship between emissions and population. The goal is to highlight global drivers of carbon emissions and their impact through dynamic visualizations.

## Features

- **Interactive Filtering System**
  - Filter by country
  - Adjust the Top N parameter for focused analysis
  - Cross-visualization filtering
  
- **Multiple Analysis Views**
  - Geographic CO2 emissions distribution
  - Time series analysis of CO2 share
  - Population vs. emissions comparison
  
- **Key Insights**
  - CO2 per capita is significantly lower in Africa and South America
  - High-income countries contribute the most to emissions
  - Historical shifts in CO2 leadership: UK (1750-1890), US (post-1890), China (leading since 2006)
  - Clear correlation between population size and emissions with notable outliers

## Technical Details
- **Platform**: Tableau Public/Desktop
- **Data Source**: Our World in Data
- **Dataset Size**: 50,599 records, 79 fields
- **File Format**: CSV

## Visualizations Include
- **Geographic Map**: CO2 emissions per capita by country (color-coded)
- **Time Series Analysis**: Percentage share of global CO2 emissions (1750-2021)
- **Scatter Plot**: CO2 emissions vs. population (bubble size indicating temperature impact)

## Purpose
This dashboard was created to:
1. Understand global CO2 emission trends and regional disparities
2. Identify historical shifts in CO2 leadership
3. Analyze the impact of population on emissions
4. Develop interactive Tableau dashboards for climate data analysis
